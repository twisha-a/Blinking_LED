# Blinking_LED
We have coded on Arduino file to time the blinking of the LED by connecting the NodeMCU to the laptop.  

## PRE-REQUISTES
1. LED
2. Breadboard
3. NodeMCU
4. Resistor - 330ohm
5. USB cable to connect laptop with nodemcu

## Steps and Connections
1. Connect the resistor and anode terminal of led in series 
2. Connect the other end of the resistor to Digital Pin D1 (NodeMCU) using a jumper wire
3. Connect the cathode termnal of led to the ground (NodeMCU) using a juper wire
4. connect the usb cable from the NodeMCU to the laptop and run the code.
